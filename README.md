# **Project Title : AG's News Topic Classification**

**Problem Description:**

The task at hand is to classify news articles into predefined categories using the AG's news topic classification dataset. The dataset contains news articles from various sources, and each article is labeled with one of four classes. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles into these classes based on their titles and descriptions.

**Dataset Description:**

- **Source:** The AG's news topic classification dataset is derived from a collection of over 1 million news articles gathered from more than 2000 news sources by the academic news search engine ComeToMyHead.

- **Classes:** The dataset consists of four classes, chosen as the four largest classes from the original corpus. Each class represents a different topic or category.

- **Data Split:** There are 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples. Each class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples.

- **File Format:** The data is provided in CSV format, with two files: train.csv for training samples and test.csv for testing samples. Each row in the CSV files contains three columns: class index (1 to 4), title, and description. The title and description are escaped using double quotes ("), and any internal double quote is escaped by two double quotes (""). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed by an "n" character, i.e., "\n".

**Objective:**

The objective is to develop a text classification model that can accurately predict the class label of news articles based on their titles and descriptions. The model will be trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

The model will be evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify news articles into their respective categories.

**Approach:**

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise, tokenizing, lemmatizing or stemming, and vectorizing the text.

2. Model Building: Build a machine learning model, such as a neural network or a traditional classifier like SVM or Random Forest, to classify the news articles into their respective classes.

3. Model Training: Train the model on the training data and tune hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and generalization ability.

5. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for making predictions on new, unseen news articles, allowing for automated categorization of news content.

By following these steps, we aim to develop an effective and accurate text classification model for categorizing news articles into relevant topics or classes.

In conclusion, we successfully developed a text classification model for categorizing news articles into relevant topics or classes using the AG's news topic classification dataset. The model demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of 90.45%. 

Key takeaways from our analysis include:

- **Dataset Overview:** The dataset comprises news articles from various sources, with each article labeled into one of four classes representing different topics or categories. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with each class containing 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples.

- **Model Building:** We employed a machine learning approach, leveraging techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The chosen model architecture effectively learned the underlying patterns in the text data to make accurate predictions.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. These metrics provided insights into the model's ability to correctly classify news articles across different classes.

- **Insights:** The classification report revealed that the model achieved high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes, with slight variations among different categories. Class 2 exhibited the highest performance metrics, while classes 3 and 4 demonstrated slightly lower but still respectable scores.

Overall, our text classification model can be deployed to automatically categorize news articles, thereby facilitating efficient content organization and information retrieval. Future enhancements could involve fine-tuning the model architecture, exploring ensemble methods, or incorporating deep learning techniques to further improve performance.
